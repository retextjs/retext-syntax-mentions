[**retext**][retext] plugin to classify
[**@mentions**](https://github.com/blog/821) as [syntax][source], not natural
language.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install retext-syntax-mentions
```

## Use

Without `syntax-mentions`:

```js
var dictionary = require('dictionary-en-gb')
var unified = require('unified')
var english = require('retext-english')
var stringify = require('retext-stringify')
var spell = require('retext-spell')
var mentions = require('retext-syntax-mentions')
var report = require('vfile-reporter')

unified()
  .use(english)
  .use(spell, dictionary)
  .use(stringify)
  .process('Misspelt? @wooorm.', function(err, file) {
    console.log(report(err || file))
  })
```

Yields:

```txt
  1:12-1:18  warning  `wooorm` is misspelt; did you mean `worm`?  retext-spell  retext-spell

⚠ 1 warning
```

With `syntax-mentions`:

```diff
   .use(english)
+  .use(mentions)
   .use(spell, dictionary)
```

Yields:

```txt
no issues found
```

## API

### `retext().use(mentions[, options])`

Classify [**@mentions**](https://github.com/blog/821) as [**source**][source],
which represent “external (ungrammatical) values” instead of natural language.
This hides mentions from [`retext-spell`][spell],
[`retext-readability`][readability], [`retext-equality`][equality], and more.

###### `options.style`

Style can be either `'github'` (for GitHub user and team mentions), `'twitter'`
(for Twitter handles), or a regular expression (such as `/^@\w{1,15}$/i`, which
is the Twitter regex).
